                         data-description="I am part of the team that developed &#34;Fact Factors,&#34; a mobile game created in Unity, focusing on the interplay between credibility and popularity in media.

                            My key contributions are as follows:

                            1. Art and Visual Direction:
                            I was responsible for designing all the artwork and logos for the game, establishing its visual identity and overall vibe. This involved creating a cohesive look that matched the game's theme and narrative. The logo was crafted using Krita as was the GDD image depicting the game, I also generated images for the in-game headlines using Stable Diffusion, after which Andrej Stojkovikj added blur in post to hide AI imperfections.

                            2. Headline and Comments, Writer
                            A significant part of the game involves writing engaging posts based on headlines. I wrote around 20 diverse headlines that ranged from comedic to serious, incorporating real and fictional elements. This variety aimed to enrich the player experience and encourage different gameplay strategies.
                            Additionally, I created a set of social media comments that players would encounter as replies to their posts within the game. This included 15 positive comments and 15 negative comments, adding depth to the gameplay and making interactions feel more authentic and relatable.

                            &#34;Fact Factors&#34; not only served as a practical application of our studies in Mediums and Communications but also provided valuable insights into the mechanics of social media and its influence on public perception. The project emphasized the importance of responsible media creation and the consequences of misinformation, making it a timely and relevant endeavor.

                            Through this project, I enhanced my skills in game design, art creation, and team collaboration. The experience reinforced my passion for combining technical skills with creative storytelling, and I look forward to applying these lessons in future projects.

                            Personally, I would love to work on a project like this again.

                            We faced the challenge of coding the device and assembling it entirely on our own, which pushed our technical skills to the limit. Our hard work paid off as we achieved 4th place out of 9 schools, showcasing our ability to problem-solve and work effectively under pressure.

                         data-description="In this project, I worked under the supervision of my Electrical Measurements professor to restore a faulty CoolerMaster MWE650 desktop power supply. The under-voltage protection circuit (UVP) was malfunctioning, causing the power supply to shut itself down on every startup. By safely removing the components in the internals of the board, I managed to bypass the UVP by first identifying it's exact location on the IC board, which I have the TechPowerUp forums to thank for.

                        This hands-on project involved using school equipment like their multimeters, testers and donor computers, allowing me to develop skills in PCB-level troubleshooting, analysis and repair, while obviously balancing functionality with safety considerations, as desktop power supplies are known to be quite dangerous when handled improperly.

                        This is most likely not something I will ever do again, as it is quite dangerous and reckless, even under supervision. I will admit it was fun though.">
